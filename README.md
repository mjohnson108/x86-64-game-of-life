# x86-64-game-of-life

Here are x86-64 assembly language implementations of the Game of Life (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). They were written under Linux 5.15.0-130-generic. They differ in the output mode, one outputs frames to the terminal, the other writes frames to bitmap files on disk. They read in well-formatted .cells files and proceed for the specified number of ticks. A repository of .cells files (and other formats) can be found here: https://conwaylife.com/patterns/
